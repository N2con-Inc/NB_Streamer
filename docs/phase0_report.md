## Project Overview
**Objective**: Develop a lightweight HTTP service for receiving activity events from Netbird and forwarding them to Graylog in GELF format. This setup will be containerized using Docker.

## Key Features and Functionalities
- **HTTP POST Endpoint**: Receives Netbird JSON events.
- **Authentication Methods**: Supports None, Bearer Token, Basic Auth, and Custom Header.
- **Event Transformation**: Converts JSON to GELF with custom NB_ prefixed fields.
- **Output Protocols**: UDP as primary, TCP as fallback.
