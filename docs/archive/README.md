This directory contains historical documentation that was created during the planning and development phases of NB_Streamer but is no longer current or relevant to the production system.

## Archived Files

- **MODULAR_REDESIGN_PROPOSAL.md** - Refactoring proposal (changes were implemented)

### Status Documents
- **REPOSITORY_SNAPSHOT.md** - Early development snapshot (claimed "documentation only" but implementation now exists)
- **CONTINUATION_SUMMARY.md** - Tactical deployment status update (now superseded by current documentation)

## Why These Were Archived

These documents served their purpose during the planning and development phases but contain outdated information that conflicts with the current implemented state of the project. They have been preserved for historical reference.
