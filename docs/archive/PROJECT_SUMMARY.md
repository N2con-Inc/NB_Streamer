# NB_Streamer Project Summary

## Project Completion Status: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

NB_Streamer has been successfully developed, tested, and deployed as a production-ready service for streaming Netbird events to Graylog with advanced field flattening and comprehensive monitoring.

## üéØ Core Objectives Achieved

### ‚úÖ Primary Goals
- **Event Reception**: FastAPI service receiving Netbird events via HTTP POST
- **GELF Transformation**: Converting events to Graylog Extended Log Format
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Configurable tenant tagging for event segregation
- **Graylog Integration**: UDP/TCP transmission to configurable Graylog servers
- **Production Deployment**: Docker containerization with environment configuration

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Features (v0.2.6)
- **Advanced Field Flattening**: Recursive parsing of nested structures into individual searchable fields
- **Real-time Statistics**: Comprehensive event processing metrics and monitoring
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Multiple authentication methods with secure token handling
- **Monitoring Tools**: User-friendly scripts and API endpoints for operational visibility

              Field Discovery & Testing
```

### Core Components
1. **FastAPI Application** (`src/main.py`) - HTTP API with authentication
2. **GELF Transformation** (`src/models/gelf.py`) - Advanced field flattening
3. **Statistics Service** (`src/services/stats.py`) - Real-time monitoring
4. **Authentication** (`src/services/auth.py`) - Multi-method security
5. **Graylog Integration** (`src/services/graylog.py`) - UDP/TCP transmission

## üìä Current Deployment Status

### Production Configuration
- **Tenant**: `n2con`
- **Graylog Server**: `wizard.n2con.int` (10.0.1.244:12201)
- **Protocol**: UDP GELF
- **Port**: 8001 (external) ‚Üí 8000 (container)
- **Authentication**: Bearer token secured

### Performance Metrics
- **Event Processing**: 17+ events processed successfully
- **Success Rate**: 100% (no failed transmissions)
- **Uptime**: Stable Docker deployment
- **Field Generation**: 15-30 individual GELF fields per event

## üîß Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Advanced Field Flattening
**Before**: Nested structures stored as JSON strings
```json
"_NB_meta": "{\"source_addr\":\"10.0.1.100\",\"port\":22}"
```

**After**: Individual searchable fields
```json
"_NB_meta_source_addr": "10.0.1.100",
"_NB_meta_port": "22"
```

### 2. Comprehensive Statistics
- Total events: received, forwarded, failed
- Per-tenant breakdown and analytics
- Success rate calculation and monitoring
- Real-time uptime and event timestamps

### 3. Enhanced Graylog Integration
- Individual field indexing for better search performance
- Consistent `_NB_` prefixing for easy filtering
- Geographic, user, and connection metadata extraction
- Dashboard-ready field structure

## üìã API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|---------|---------------|
| GET | `/health` | Service health check | No |
| GET | `/stats` | Event processing statistics | No |
| POST | `/events` | Receive Netbird events | Yes |
| POST | `/stats/reset` | Reset statistics counters | Yes |

## üõ†Ô∏è Operational Tools

### Monitoring Script
```bash
./monitor_nb_streamer.sh          # Single check
./monitor_nb_streamer.sh --watch  # Continuous monitoring
```

### Field Testing
```bash
./test_flattening.py              # Demonstrate field flattening
```

### Docker Management
```bash
docker logs -f nb_streamer        # Live log monitoring
docker stats nb_streamer          # Resource usage
```

## üîç Graylog Search Examples

### Basic Filtering
```
_NB_tenant:"n2con"                        # All n2con events
_NB_meta_protocol:"TCP"                   # TCP connections only
_NB_meta_source_addr:"192.168.1.*"       # Specific source network
```

### Advanced Analytics
```
_NB_meta_connection_info_encrypted:"true" # Encrypted connections
_NB_additional_data_geo_location_country:"US" # US-based events
_NB_meta_user_info_username:"admin"       # Admin user actions
```
