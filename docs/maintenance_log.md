# Maintenance Log

## Phase: Update & Redeploy – 2025-08-01

### Goal
Update NB_Streamer from GitHub repository and redeploy the application to ensure we have the latest codebase and improvements.

### Rules Being Followed
Based on project requirements and best practices, this phase will adhere to the following rules:

1. **Docker Compose Usage**: Build and test with Docker images, targeting the project to use Docker Compose for consistency and isolation
2. **SSH for Git**: Always use SSH for GitHub actions, not HTTPS, to ensure secure repository access
3. **Semantic Versioning**: Bug fixes and tweaks increment build by 0.0.1, new features/functions increment by 0.1.0, and major versions increment manually by 1.0.0
4. **Virtual Environment Usage**: If local installation/building is needed, always use virtual environments to avoid creating issues on local hosts
5. **Documentation Priority**: Always document what we are working on (phase, task, etc.) before starting, and update documentation when tasks are completed
6. **Simplicity in Design**: Prioritize simplicity in design; re-evaluate complexity and break into sub-programs/modules as needed
7. **Phase Breakdown**: Break down planned phases into sub-phases and tackle them one at a time in appropriate order, validating work as we go

### High-Level Step List

**TEAM SIGN-OFF REQUIRED BEFORE EXECUTION**

The following steps will be executed during this update and redeploy phase:

1. **Document phase kickoff** ✓
   - Create maintenance_log.md entry with goals, rules, and step list
   - Obtain team sign-off before proceeding

2. **Pre-update backup and validation**
   - Create backup of current deployment state
   - Document current version and configuration
   - Validate current system health

3. **Repository update**
   - Fetch latest changes from GitHub using SSH
   - Review and merge any pending changes
   - Update local repository to latest commit

4. **Dependency and configuration review**
   - Review requirements.txt and pyproject.toml for changes
   - Update Docker Compose configuration if needed
   - Verify environment configuration (.env files)

5. **Build and test updated version**
   - Build new Docker images with updated codebase
   - Run comprehensive tests to validate functionality
   - Perform integration testing

6. **Version increment and tagging**
   - Determine appropriate version increment based on changes
   - Update version numbers following semantic versioning rules
   - Create appropriate Git tags

7. **Deployment execution**
   - Deploy updated version using Docker Compose
   - Verify successful deployment
   - Monitor system health post-deployment

8. **Documentation and cleanup**
   - Update deployment documentation
   - Document any issues encountered and resolutions
   - Clean up temporary files and unused Docker images

### Status
**AWAITING TEAM SIGN-OFF** - Phase documented and ready for execution pending team approval.

### Notes
- This phase follows all established project rules and best practices
- Each step will be validated before proceeding to the next
- Any issues encountered will be documented for future reference
- Rollback procedures are available if needed
