# Repository Snapshot: NB_Streamer

**Repository Path**: `/Users/legend/Documents/GitHub/NB_Streamer`  
**Generated**: July 30, 2025  
**Status**: Early Development Phase (Documentation Only)

## Overview

This repository contains the **Netbird Event Streaming Receiver** project - a lightweight HTTP service designed to receive streamed activity events from Netbird and forward them to Graylog as GELF messages. The project is currently in the documentation and planning phase.

## Repository Structure

### üìã Documentation Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `PROJECT.md` | **Primary Project Documentation** - Comprehensive software development plan containing requirements, architecture, implementation phases, and technical specifications for the Netbird-to-Graylog event streaming service | ‚úÖ Complete |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **Development Guidance Document** - Provides context and guidance for AI assistants working with this codebase, including architecture overview, configuration details, and common development tasks | ‚úÖ Complete |

### üö´ Missing/Planned Components

Based on the project documentation, the following components are planned but not yet implemented:

#### Application Code (Not Present)
- `app/main.py` - Main FastAPI application with `/events` endpoint
- `app/gelf.py` - GELF transformation logic (Netbird ‚Üí GELF with NB_ prefixes)
- `setup.py` - Interactive setup script for deployment configuration

#### Configuration Files (Not Present)  
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python project configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition using python:3.10-slim base
- `docker-compose.yml` - Generated by setup script for deployment

#### Testing Infrastructure (Not Present)
- `tests/` directory - Unit and integration tests using pytest
- Test files for event transformation, authentication, and integration testing

#### Deployment Files (Not Present)
- Docker configuration files
- Compose files for orchestration

## Project Architecture Summary

**Technology Stack**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Docker  
**Primary Function**: HTTP endpoint (`/events`) that receives Netbird JSON events and forwards them as GELF messages to Graylog  
**Deployment Model**: Containerized service behind reverse proxy for TLS termination

### Key Features (Planned):
- Multiple authentication methods (None, Bearer Token, Basic Auth, Custom Header)
- Event transformation with `NB_` prefixed custom fields
- UDP/TCP GELF output to Graylog (compressed)
- Interactive setup script for deployment configuration
- Environment variable-based configuration

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Pre-development (Documentation Complete)  
**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 implementation (Setup and Prototyping)

The repository currently contains comprehensive planning and documentation but no implementation code. Based on the PROJECT.md timeline, this is a 7-11 day development effort across 7 phases, with the current state representing completed planning phase.

## Configuration Requirements

When implemented, the service will be configured via environment variables:
- Authentication settings (`AUTH_TYPE`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_CUSTOM_HEADER`)
- Graylog connection (`GRAYLOG_HOST`, `GRAYLOG_PORT`, `GRAYLOG_PROTOCOL`) 
- Service settings (`PORT`, `DEFAULT_HOST`)

## Repository Health

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive project documentation
- ‚úÖ Clear architecture and requirements
- ‚úÖ Detailed implementation plan with phases
- ‚ùå No implementation code yet
- ‚ùå No dependency management files
- ‚ùå No testing infrastructure
- ‚ùå No containerization files

**Recommendation**: Ready to begin development Phase 1 (Setup and Prototyping) as outlined in PROJECT.md.
