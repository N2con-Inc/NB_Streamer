# NB_Streamer: Project Vision & Scope Statement

**Project Name**: NB_Streamer (Netbird Event Streaming Receiver)  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Development Phase - Ready for Implementation  

## Primary Objective

**NB_Streamer** is a lightweight, containerized HTTP service designed to act as a bridge between Netbird's activity event streaming and Graylog logging infrastructure. The primary objective is to:

- **Receive** streamed activity events from Netbird via HTTP POST endpoints
- **Transform** JSON events into GELF (Graylog Extended Log Format) with custom Netbird field prefixes
- **Forward** processed events to external Graylog instances via UDP/TCP protocols
- **Provide** a seamless, configurable, and secure integration point for Netbird event monitoring

## Intended End-Users & Use Cases

### Primary End-Users
- **DevOps Engineers** managing Netbird VPN infrastructure who need centralized logging
- **System Administrators** requiring real-time monitoring of network peer activities
- **Security Teams** implementing audit trails for VPN connection events
- **IT Operations Teams** needing integrated log management for distributed networks

### Key Use Cases
1. **Real-time Event Monitoring**: Stream live Netbird peer connection/disconnection events to Graylog dashboards
2. **Security Auditing**: Centralize VPN activity logs for compliance and security analysis
3. **Infrastructure Observability**: Integrate Netbird events with existing log aggregation pipelines
4. **Incident Response**: Enable rapid troubleshooting through consolidated event streaming
5. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Support development, staging, and production Netbird instances

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **HTTP Endpoint**: Expose `/events` POST endpoint to receive Netbird JSON events
- **Authentication Support**: Configurable auth methods (None, Bearer Token, Basic Auth, Custom Header)
- **Event Transformation**: Convert Netbird JSON to GELF format with `NB_` prefixed custom fields:
  - `NB_ID`, `NB_TIMESTAMP`, `NB_MESSAGE`, `NB_INITIATOR_ID`, `NB_TARGET_ID`, `NB_META`, `NB_REFERENCE`
- **GELF Output**: Send compressed UDP datagrams to Graylog (with TCP fallback support)
- **Interactive Setup**: Python-based setup script generating customized `docker-compose.yml` files
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint for container orchestration

### Data Processing
- **Input Format**: Netbird default JSON events (ID, Timestamp, Message, InitiatorID, TargetID, Meta, Reference)
- **Output Format**: GELF v1.1 compliant JSON with compressed UDP transmission
- **Field Mapping**: Preserve all Netbird data with custom prefixing for Graylog compatibility

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Throughput**: Handle up to 100 events per second sustained load
- **Latency**: Process each event within 100ms end-to-end
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint suitable for containerized deployment

### Security
- **Authentication**: Flexible auth integration matching Netbird's configuration options
- **Container Security**: Run as non-root user with minimal base image (python:3.10-slim)
- **Configuration Security**: All sensitive parameters via environment variables (no hardcoded secrets)

### Reliability
- **Stateless Design**: Enable horizontal scaling and fault tolerance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on invalid input or Graylog connectivity issues
- **Logging**: Comprehensive service logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **Zero Data Persistence**: Pure event forwarding without local storage dependencies

### Operational
- **Containerization**: Full Docker support with docker-compose orchestration
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variable-based configuration for all deployment parameters
- **Reverse Proxy Ready**: HTTP-only internal service designed for TLS termination at proxy layer
- **Cross-Platform**: Python-based implementation supporting multiple deployment environments

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- HTTP service development (FastAPI-based)
- GELF transformation and UDP/TCP transmission logic
- Multi-method authentication middleware
- Interactive deployment setup scripting
- Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Docker containerization and orchestration files
- Documentation and deployment guides

### Out of Scope
- Reverse proxy implementation or configuration
- Graylog server setup or management
- Advanced features: event batching, complex retries, custom Netbird templates
- Monitoring infrastructure beyond basic logging
- Database persistence or event replay capabilities
- UI/web interface for service management

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Success**: Successfully receive, transform, and forward Netbird events to Graylog with 100% data fidelity
2. **Performance Success**: Meet 100 events/second throughput with <100ms latency requirements
3. **Operational Success**: Deploy via setup script and docker-compose with minimal manual configuration
4. **Integration Success**: Seamless integration with existing Netbird and Graylog infrastructures
5. **Security Success**: Support all Netbird authentication methods without security vulnerabilities

## Project Timeline

- **Total Estimated Duration**: 7-11 development days
- **Current Status**: Documentation complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation
- **Next Milestone**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup and Prototyping) - 1-2 days
